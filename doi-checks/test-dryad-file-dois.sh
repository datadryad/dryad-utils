# This script expects to read DOIs from standard input, one per line.
#
# It will try to resolve the DOI using dx.doi.org. If resolution fails,
# it will interpret it as a Dryad file DOI, will strip a trailing slash
# followed by one or more digits, and interpret the result as a Dryad
# package DOI that is expected to resolve.
#
# DOIs that fail to resolve as files, but for which the package resolves,
# are reported as "fails". If the package fails too, that fact is reported
# alongside.
#
# Prints results to stdout in tab-delimited format, one line per DOI. First
# column is file DOI, second is status ("resolves", "fails", or "fails and
# package fails").
